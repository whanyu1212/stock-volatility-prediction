## Summary:
This project utilizes **LSTM-GARCH**, **SVR-GARCH**, and **Stacking** methodologies to forecast two distinct forms of stock market volatility: realized and implied. Realized volatility is determined using historical price data, capturing the actual fluctuations in asset prices over time and reflecting historical market behavior. On the other hand, implied volatility is extrapolated from the pricing of options, representing market predictions of future volatility and shaped by factors such as market sentiment and options demand. The combined analysis of both volatility types not only enhances risk management and investment strategy development but also enriches the understanding of market dynamics, offering critical insights for endeavors like algorithmic trading.
